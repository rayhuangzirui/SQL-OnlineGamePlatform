# 🎮Steam Games Database🎮
## Project Description 📝
This project will focus on Steam, a popular online game distribution platform launched in 2003. Unlike regular retail business and online shopping, the Steam platform includes many other functions for the users/players like “Community” and “Sales Event”. Thus, instead of focusing on the transaction, our group wants to focus on the domain of user habit. For example, we will include several entities like user, community, company, sales event, genre, support ticket, and game. More details about their relationships and assumptions can be found in the ER Diagram section. 

## Database Specification 📍
Our Steam database will provide a wide range of functionality. Firstly, we are hoping that our database can be used for marketers to perform customer behavior analysis and assist the company’s future marketing plans. We believe our project will be able to help answer the questions like: “Which games/game genre has the most active gamers community?”. Additionally, we also want our database to be used by the publisher/developer to determine potential updates and improvements. Moreover, this project will provide an opportunity for players to find their next favorite games by searching for trending games or new game releases. 

## Application Platform 💻
This database is implemented by the Oracle server provided by the UBC Computer Science department. We used PHP for front-end implementation.
